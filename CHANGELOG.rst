Version 0.7.2
=============
- Modified to generate mapplots from SMOS L3 as reference. Includes small change in metadata plots labels.

Version 0.7.1
=============
- Add alternative dataset names

Version 0.7
===========
- Added a new dataset to the reader (SMOS L3), including functions to deal with missing datasets specifications (version name, units, ..)

Version 0.6.4

- Includes methods to read the metadata variables from the output netCDF file. The plot_all function in qa4sm_reader.plot_all.py has now a switch that produces (if the necessary information is available in the output file) metadata boxplots based on:
 - Land cover classes (CCI Landcover)
 - Climate classes (Koeppen-Geiger classification)
 - Soil granulometry (coarse - medium - fine)
- All the tests have been updated to accomodate for this.

Version 0.5.2
